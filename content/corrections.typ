// Readable list of the confirmed deviations of this edition from the
// printed book (corrections.json), built as a separate PDF. An entry prints
// its id, printed page, place, the printed reading, the correction and the
// reason; `verified_by` (how the correction was checked) stays in the
// journal.
//
// `original`, `corrected` and `reason` are Typst markup: most entries quote
// formulas, so they are evaluated with the book's own definitions (GL, Ad,
// the reference helpers are not needed here) to read as in the book.

// The entries quote numbers as printed, "Chapter 6", "Problem 2.3.9",
// "[56]": the objects and the list of references are not in this separate
// document, and a reference (`@ch:lie-groups`, `@bib:Wolf1972`) would
// print "?" (the book's reference rule, applied here too).

below; page numbers are those of the printed book.
